# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

To run a React Vite app that you've downloaded from GitHub, you'll need to follow these general steps:

Clone the Repository:
Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing <repository-url> with the URL of the GitHub repository:

git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the Project Directory:

Change your working directory to the project folder:

cd <project-folder>
Install Dependencies:

Before you can run the app, you need to install its dependencies. In a Vite project, this is typically done using npm. Run one of the following commands:

npm install

Using yarn:
- yarn install
  
Start the Development Server:
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server. Vite comes with a built-in development server. Run the following command:

Using npm:
- npm run dev
  
Using yarn:
-yarn dev

This command will start the development server and should automatically open a new browser window/tab displaying your React Vite app. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Development and Testing:
You can now make changes to the React code, and the development server will automatically reload the app as you save your changes. You can also access the development console in your browser for debugging.

Building for Production (Optional):
When you're ready to build your app for production, you can use the following command:

Using npm:
npm run build

Using yarn:
-yarn build
This will create an optimized production build of your React Vite app in a dist or build folder. You can then deploy this build to a web server or hosting platform of your choice.
